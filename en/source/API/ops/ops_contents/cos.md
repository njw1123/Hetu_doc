#### hetu.cos

Computes the cosine of each element in the input tensor element-wise: output = cos(input).

**Parameters:**

* input (hetu.tensor): The input tensor, which can have any shape.

* inplace (bool, optional): Whether to perform the operation in-place. Default is False.

**Returns:**

* hetu.tensor: A new tensor with the same shape as the input, containing the cosine of each element.
